FOR BACKEND
    - we will use convex for our backend and we will use clerk for our authentication
    - GO to developers then documentation and follow quick start guide of a convex

    To install convex : 
    type:  npm install convex
    to run it just type : npx convex dev
    Then you will be asked to select existing project or to select new project and then after setup 
    you will be given the link to the dashboard

    --you have to keep running convex in order to keep use it
    what we need to worry about is clerk connection
    go to clerk.com and login

    inside convex we need to create our api and functions

    Now refer to convex docs to create auth with clerk and how to put issuer url from clerk to convex
    after setup of auth.config.js and publishing changes 

    install convex react library by Installing npm install @clerk/clerk-react

    then we will need to connect providers of convex and clerk 
    *remember* we need to keep running convex in our terminal 
    so now create a new file in provider and add convex-provider.tsx file

    remember- convex is our database and clerk provides auth
